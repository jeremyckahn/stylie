# Sitylie - First blog post

I'm trying something new with this project.  I want to maintain a development blog, because I'm learning a lot and I think it's helpful to share.  What better place to keep the blog than the project repo itself?  Distribution is as easy it is to distribute the app itself.  And, since Stylie is hosted on Github and this is a Markdown file, the blog posts will be beautifully rendered with Github's excellent Markdown rendering engine.  This also gives me super-easy image uploads, code snippet rendering, and versioning support.

Let's see how this goes!
