#Stylie - A CSS3 animation generator.

More complete docs will come, this is just here so you know I didn't forget to
write a README.  This is an app that lets you graphically create CSS3
`transform` animations (fun!), so you don't have to write code to do it (not
fun!).  You can play with the latest stable version
[here](http://jeremyckahn.github.com/stylie/).

__Note!__  This app is still early in development.  Things may be incomplete,
broken, or just plain weird.  Please file an
[issue](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/stylie/issues) if you'd like to see a
feature added or want to discuss something about this app.
