#Stylie - A CSS3 animation generator.

More complete docs will come, this is just here so you know I didn't forget to write a README.  This is an app that lets you graphically create CSS3 animations (fun!), so you don't have to write code to do it (not always fun!).  You can play with the latest stable version [here](http://jeremyckahn.github.com/stylie/).

__Note!__  This app is still early in development.  Things may be incomplete, broken, or just plain weird.  If you find something really wrong with the app, there's a good chance I know about it too.  However, don't be afraid to chime in with an [issue](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/stylie/issues) if you'd like to see a feature added or you just think the whole thing is crazy.

__Also note!__ Development on Stylie is currently stalled.  It is certainly not dead, however.  The developer is simply focusing his time on bringing [Rekapi](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/rekapi) to [version 1.0](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/rekapi/wiki/1.0-Roadmap).  Rekapi is a key dependency of Stylie, and a better Rekapi means a better Stylie.  Sit tight!
