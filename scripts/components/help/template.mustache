    <h1>Web animation made easy!</h1>
    <p>Stylie is a fun tool for easily creating complex web animations. Quickly design your animation graphically, grab the generated code and go!</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OObt9DxNxe8" target="_blank">Watch this screencast for a tutorial.</a></p>
    <h2>If you like this tool, check out Mantra</h2>
    <p>Stylie is part of a larger, much more powerful tool called <a href="https://jeremyckahn.github.io/mantra/" target="_blank">Mantra</a>.  In addition to Stylie's drag-and-drop tween editing, Mantra provides a timeline editing tool for tweaking animations at a more granular level.  Since Stylie is built right in (press the <strong>T</strong> key in Mantra), you won't have to re-learn anything.  It's a natural step if you want to take your animations to the next level!</p>
    <p>Stylie predates Mantra and is still useful in isolation, which is why it exists here as an independent app as well as an embedded tool in Mantra.  <strong>If you are just getting started with Stylie, it is recommended that you head over to <a href="https://jeremyckahn.github.io/mantra/" target="_blank">Mantra</a> and learn how to use that instead</strong>, as it has a more extensive feature roadmap than Stylie.  Both tools are completely open source and free to use.</p>
    <p>You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdaMUBu-D4E" target="_blank">this quick screencast</a> to learn how to use Stylie within Mantra and get even more out of both tools.</p>

    <h2>The Stylie Workflow</h2>
    <p>When you open the app, you will see a little ball moving from left to right. To change the beginning and ending positions of the animation, just click and drag the crosshairs. You can click the button in the lower-right to enter Rotation/Scale Mode and make rotation cubes appear over the crosshairs.  Click and drag these cubes to modify the the X and Y rotation axes, and drag the extended rotation handle to modify the Z axis rotation.  Additionally, you can scroll your mouse while hovering over a cube to modify the scale of the element.  Click the button again to exit Rotation/Scale Mode.</p>
    <img src="img/shift_example.png" class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of Stylie while the rotation Cubelets are shown">
    <h2>Keyframe editing</h2>
    <p>You can add, remove and edit keyframes.  This is done in the &quot;Keyframes&quot; tab.  When you first open Stylie, you are presented with the default keyframes.  Keyframe 0 cannot be moved and has no easing properties associated with it, but all of the other keyframes do.  To add a new keyframe, click the &quot;Add a Keyframe&quot; button in the upper right portion of the tab.</p>
    <img src="img/keyframes_tab.png" class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of the Keyframes tab.">
    <p>&quot;rX,&quot; &quot;rY&quot; and &quot;rZ&quot; refer to the three rotation axes, and &quot;s&quot; refers to the scale value.  You can add as many keyframes as you'd like.  You can also reorder keyframes by clicking their &quot;ms&quot; value and pressing the Enter key.</p>
    <img src="img/keyframe_editing.png" class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of keyframes being edited.">
    <p>You can tweak individual keyframe properties by pressing the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; arrow keys when focusing on a property's text input.  You can change individual properties' easing curve by selecting it from the dropdown next to each text input.  To remove a keyframe, click the &quot;X&quot; in the upper right corner of its form field.</p>
    <h2>Group selection</h2>
    <p>You can select multiple keyframe crosshairs for simultaneous editing by holding the Shift key on your keyboard and clicking the crosshairs.  This also works with Rotation/Scale mode.  Group selection is handy for quickly applying similar keyframe modifications across an animation.</p>
    <img src="img/group_selection.png" class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of group keyframe selection.">
    <h2>Motion control</h2>
    <p>In addition to the standard easing curves, you can define your own custom curves in the &quot;Motion&quot; tab.  To do this, select or create a "customEasing" from the dropdown and drag the circular handles.  You can also type in the coordinates for the control points.  Once you have defined your custom curve, you can select it from any property's easing dropdown.</p>
    <img src="img/bezier_editing.png" class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of a bezier curve being edited.">
    <h2>Playback control</h2>
    <p>There is a scrubber in the bottom left of the screen. This is fully interactive; you can can play, pause and stop the animation. You can also click and drag the scrubber and zip to any part of the timeline.</p>
    <h2>Exporting your animation</h2>
    <p>Once you&#x27;ve tweaked the animation to your liking, it is time to export it to be used in your web page. From the &quot;Export&quot; tab in the control panel, you can export your animation to either <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation" target="_blank">CSS <code>@keyframes</code></a> or a <a href="https://jeremyckahn.github.io/rekapi/doc/" target="_blank">Rekapi</a>-based JavaScript animation.  Select the format you would like from the dropdown.</p>
    <h3>CSS animations</h3>
    <p>You can tweak the generated CSS for your specific needs, such as the name of the CSS class on the DOM element to be animated, the number of times to iterate the animation, and which browser vendors you want to support. Stylie will optimize simpler animations, but more complex animations will generate very verbose CSS, so be aware of that. You can control the size of the generated CSS for complex animations with the slider above the CSS text box.  You can paste the generated CSS into <a href="https://codepen.io/jeremyckahn/pen/EjKPGQ" target="_blank">this CodePen</a> to test it.</p>

    <h3>Rekapi animations</h3>
    <p>If you are using Stylie to create a lot of animations, it may make more sense to load each animation as JSON, rather than CSS, to be imported and run with Rekapi.  To do this, select the &quot;Rekapi&quot; option from the dropdown in the &quot;Export&quot; panel.  You can use <a href="https://jeremyckahn.github.io/rekapi-export-test/" target="_blank">this tool</a> to test out the export and learn how to integrate it into your project.</p>

    <h2>Saving your animation</h2>
    <p>You can save your animation to <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage" target="_blank">HTML5 Local Storage</a>.  To do this, open the wrench menu and type in the name of your animation.  You can also recall saved animations from this menu.</p>
